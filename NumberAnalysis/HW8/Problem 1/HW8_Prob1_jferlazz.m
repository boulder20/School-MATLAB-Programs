% A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE PROGRAM OR FUNCTION DOES
% This program simulates cotters method for an user inputted number of
% factors based on a list of trial outputs also inputted by the user
% then the programs outputs the odd and even contrast, effect measure and
% sensitiveity of each factor in an output table

%   Inputs

%Takes user input

%Terminate the program if the number of output values are too many or
%too few
